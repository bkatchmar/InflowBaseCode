		<h2 class="alt">Our Story</h2>
		<p class="heading">In early 2017, our founder saw a post on the WeWork chat board from a freelancer asking about ways to recoup payment from a client that was three months overdue on their latest check. </p>
		<p class="heading">What surprised our team the most was the lack of options a freelancer could take to resolve instances of non-payment.  Rather than accepting the status quo our team has worked diligently ever since to bring to market a solution designed meet the diverse needs of the freelance community</p>
